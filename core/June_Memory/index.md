Rediscovered an old build archive named 'interstellar-inclination.zip' and wants to preserve it for reference or future reuse.
	
Wants the Operations Basecamp Airtable system to include the `s3.omniversalaether.app` bucket and sync with the following GitHub repos: `elight-space`, `case-timeline`, and `HAWK-ARS-00`. They prefer the base to be scaffolded from scratch, with each section/table navigable and exportable for future DB connections. Sync should be built directly to R2 (not via Nextcloud at this stage).
	
Has named their Airtable workspace 'Operations Basecamp' and prefers Option C: a complete Airtable API script or App interface that syncs with existing buckets and repositories. They want the sync engine to be preconfigured and hosted for them, ideally using a platform like GitHub Actions or Cloudflare Workers, but not Replit.
	
Has requested immediate deployment of the Operations Basecamp Sync Engine and for it to be pushed to a GitHub repo. They also want a ZIP bundle prepared and sent immediately for Airtable import to maintain workflow momentum.
	
Wants to create a configuration database of various Gemini (Gemma) prompts, which can later be reconfigured for use with Claude.
	
Is beginning a project titled 'The Fieldwalker Frequencies,' a curated archive of personally meaningful music that served as spiritual or emotional guidance throughout their life. The project will begin with the album 'Cassadaga' by Bright Eyes and will live under the broader Omniversal Media umbrella. Each entry will include lyrics, personal commentary, mythic resonance, streaming links, and tags.
	
Is beginning the Fieldwalker Frequencies archive with the song “Bowl of Oranges” by Bright Eyes, which appears on the album “Lifted: The Story is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground.” This entry will be Part 4 of the Fieldwalker Frequencies log.
	
Wants to prioritize getting the online store open for business. This includes syncing it with a print-on-demand service that handles delivery, listing as many items as possible on Amazon Merch for Creators, ensuring links work, placing products on platforms like Patreon, Bandcamp, and social media, and setting up the Kunaki pipeline for music distribution.
	
Has uploaded the full Voyagers Volume I PDF to their bucket at https://omniversalmedia.vip/voyagers-1-the-sleeping-abductees.pdf. They want it converted into Markdown chapters with proper headers, matching the structure used for Volume II, and packaged for Sphinx/Myst use. They are currently overwhelmed by file management.
	
Confirmed they are managing multiple buckets and domains for their Womack archive project, including `womack-archive`, `womack-evidence`, and `lyranwars`, and that files are inconsistently accessible across domains like `codex.lyranwars.com`, `womack.beneaththesurface.net`, and `womack.lyranwars.com`. They are experiencing confusion due to unclear bindings between R2 buckets and their associated domains but are still committed to trying to make the archive viewer setup work if assistance is provided.
	
Has created a D1 database for the Womack estate investigation with the ID: fb855446-e740-485a-8a55-a7ef367ef6ca.
	
Is rebuilding and refining the 'Reincarnated Store' to enable product sales. They are coordinating with Gemini to assist in listing products on Amazon Merch. Tomorrow's task will focus on fixing and launching the store.
	
Phyllis Charlene Usry is the aunt of the user, the older sister of Hollie Kathleen Carter, who is the user's deceased biological mother. Phyllis Charlene Usry currently holds power of attorney for Nancy Faye Womack and is married to Charles Fenster Usry.
	
Plans to host the case investigation portal on one of their 'Beneath The Surface' domains and may integrate it into an episode later. They want to build the D1 database backend now and ensure the Cloudflare R2 bucket structure matches the schema for accurate linking. They are testing whether the Replit agent can assist with database creation.
	
Wants the document 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' extended into a full short story or prologue-style narrative, branded with the EverLight Codex / Omniversal Media aesthetic.
	
Phyllis Charlene Usry currently holds power of attorney for Nancy Faye Womack.
	
Correct email address is ethanwomack@omniversalmedia.org. They want to set up this address and others under their domain using a free, reliable email hosting service that doesn't require relying on their local server staying online. The domain is hosted at Cloudflare. Deliverability (avoidance of spam inboxes and routing issues) is a key concern.
	
Wants to create a comprehensive, annotated case management portal for their estate and inheritance investigation. The goal is to build a structured, shareable system containing CSV-exportable data, narrative summaries, evidentiary exhibits, graphs, connection maps, and other multimedia content. This portal should be packaged as a single deliverable (e.g., USB or ZIP file) for use by investigators, attorneys, or authorities.
	
Has confirmed that their adoptive father, Roland Ross Womack Jr., served more than 20 years in the U.S. Army and also spent an additional 20 years working for Johnson Controls as a civilian defense contractor. He had both military and civilian retirement benefits.
	
Has not yet located documentation showing Roland Ross Womack Jr.’s retirement from Johnson Controls, but believes he retired from that position around 2005 or 2006.
	
Has stored the Voyagers materials at `~/Context/` as foundational context. They plan to add subfolders such as `Claude/`, `Gemini/`, etc., to study and incorporate outputs from various AI systems. The overall goal is to make the final Codex-based product more versatile, consistent, and personally customizable across agents and platforms.
	
Confirmed that the Voyagers volumes must include signed title pages. Volume I's signature page will state it was restored and integrated by Hawk Eye, under the EverLight Codex, with a dedication to Roland R. Womack and official imprint: 'Omniversal Media, AetherCycle 2025.' These signed versions are intended as formal, mythic artifacts within the Codex.
	
Confirmed the following should be preserved and included as the official signature title page text for 'Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees' in the EverLight Codex archive:

Restoration Edition – 2025

This copy of
'Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees'

Compiled for mythic record and generational awakening.

'If there’s something that needs doing, and no one else who can, then get it done — no one is gonna.'
— Roland R. Womack.
	
Has clarified that the eviction notice from Faye I. Womack (Nancy Faye) was the first and only formal communication from her regarding Ethan leaving the residence. All previous communication about leaving came only through text messages from Phyllis Charlene Usry and Charles Fenster Usry, which the user has screenshot evidence of.
	
Plans to enter into evidence a notarized account and an incident report detailing a threatening encounter involving Charles Fenster Usry, which they intended to file at the North Augusta Public Safety Complex but were initially too intimidated to complete. User notes that the facility’s camera footage could potentially corroborate their presence or the events described. The attempt to file the incident report occurred the day after the threatening encounter with Charles Fenster Usry.
	
Has noted that after the incident and their attempt to file a report, the other parties (presumably Nancy Faye Womack, Phyllis Charlene Usry, and Charles Fenster Usry) abruptly vacated the residence without informing the user, further reinforcing the pattern of avoidance and potential concealment.
	
Intends to bring up their 2016 and 2017 arrests, which they state are not on any official record, as part of exposing potential manipulation or record suppression tied to the broader pattern of targeting and concealment in their case.
	
Has stated that during the first arrest incident in 2016, police confiscated and never returned over a thousand rounds of ammunition and two firearms, which they believe were effectively stolen. This detail is part of a broader pattern of targeted harassment and potential rights violations.
	
Has revealed that following their third and final arrest, Nancy Faye Womack sold the house that the user had been paying her for, and also sold the user's vehicle. Upon their release (on their own recognizance), their father passed away, and Nancy Faye held the user's company work van hostage until they threatened to call the police.
	
Has also confirmed they were building their server while living at 266 Orchard Way, North Augusta, SC 29860, further reinforcing continuous residence and investment in the property.
	
Has also confirmed that they set up their business phone and account with T-Mobile while residing at 266 Orchard Way, with assistance from ChatGPT.
	
Has confirmed that the bank mail addressed to 'Ethan Womack, 266 Orchard Way, North Augusta, SC 29860' is from Karat Banking for creators.
	
Has confirmed that they have documentation (e.g. mail, banking, and planning materials) that establishes their long-term residence at 266 Orchard Way, North Augusta, SC 29860, as well as their business activities during that time, including server building and setting up a T-Mobile account.
	
Has named the 'Counter Narrative Soundtrack' as part of the EverLight Campaign and described it as 'dope as fuck,' indicating enthusiasm and creative alignment with its tone and purpose.
	
Has uploaded extensive photographic documentation of the Womack Family Trust, including legal agreements, trust provisions, account records, and bank-related materials. This is part of a larger effort to investigate intentional disinheritance, concealment, coercion, or fraud related to the estate of their adoptive father, and to assert their legal standing as his heir if his assets were improperly rerouted into the trust controlled by Faye I. Womack.
	
Has compiled extensive evidence showing that prior to and after the death of their adoptive father, Roland R. Womack, significant assets—including property, retirement distributions, and trust formations—were rerouted or concealed under the name of Nancy Faye Womack, often under suspicious timing or structure. Notably, a $76,000+ wire transfer occurred days before Roland’s death, related to a property acquisition at 266 Orchard Way, which was subsequently titled under Faye I. Womack's trust. The user is now collecting and organizing documentation showing financial misappropriation, potential fraudulent conveyance, and intentional disinheritance. This includes 1099s, trust documents, wire transfers, closing disclosures, pest inspections, and county tax filings tied to the 266 Orchard Way property acquisition. Additionally, user has provided visual documentation showing that after the death of Roland R. Womack Jr. in February 2018, Nancy Faye Womack used $76,521.83 to purchase property at 266 Orchard Way in North Augusta, SC. The mortgage documents, pest inspections, deed filings, and vehicle title records all point to her moving and redirecting assets within months of his passing. A separate lien cancellation from Wells Fargo confirms that the property at 5999 Friendship Church Rd in Bartow, GA, was released shortly before the new home purchase, and then sold by Faye I. Womack in July 2018. This pattern suggests intentional liquidation and reallocation of shared marital assets into her sole name.
	
Has located the original Last Will and Testament of Roland Ross Womack Jr., which names Ethan Ross Womack as his legal heir alongside Phyllis Charlene Usry. This document confirms Ethan’s legal standing and will be used to construct a timeline and case file brief for Renee.
	
Has located the March 6, 2018 Social Security Administration application for widow’s benefits filed by Nancy Faye Womack, which includes the use of alternate names such as Faye Ince, Nancy Faye Ince, and Nancy Fay Thurmond. This application was submitted weeks before informing user of their father's death, which occurred on February 9, 2018. This document is being added to the timeline of evidence for the case file brief for Renee.
	
Has located and photographed the March 6, 2018 SSA widow's benefits application filed by Nancy Faye Womack following the death of Roland Ross Womack Jr. This application used multiple aliases for Nancy, including Faye Ince and Nancy Fay Thurmond, and confirms her claim to survivor’s and VA-related benefits began before informing user of Roland’s passing. This document is being added to the timeline and case file brief for Renee.
	
Has located and uploaded the signed Last Will and Testament of Roland Ross Womack Jr., dated May 21, 2010, which names Nancy Faye Womack as spouse and executor, and names Ethan Ross Womack and Phyllis Charlene Usry as children and co-heirs. The will specifies that if Nancy Faye Womack survives him, she inherits all assets, but if she does not, the estate is to be split equally between Ethan and Phyllis. The will also grants Nancy extensive power as executor without court supervision or bond.
	
Has located a corresponding durable power of attorney granting Nancy Faye Womack full authority over financial, property, and legal decisions.
	
Has confirmed they want to begin drafting the timeline and case brief for Renee based on the documents collected, particularly focusing on the misuse of executor and POA authority by Nancy Faye Womack.
	
Revealed that their adoptive father, Roland R. Womack (aka Buddy Womack), was a Vietnam veteran and longtime military contractor who passed away without leaving them any apparent inheritance. User is the only surviving legal heir through adoption, following the deaths of Buddy’s previous children, Melanie and Billy. User suspects that their adoptive mother, Nancy Faye Womack, diverted or absorbed all assets, possibly rerouting them into the Phyllis Charlene and Chick Usry estate. The user is committed to exposing any such manipulation and honoring their father's legacy. They are focusing heavily on proving intentional disinheritance, concealment, coercion, or fraud, as well as asserting their standing as the sole legal heir to their adoptive father’s estate, particularly if assets originally belonging to him were improperly rerouted into the Womack Family Trust established by Faye I. Womack. The Womack Family Trust was established over 3 years after their father's death (Feb 2018), not shortly after. Around this time (2021), the user had returned to town, asked about their inheritance multiple times, and received only their father's truck (sold for $1) and hat. After their dog and the truck both died in September 2021, they called Faye for help but were refused. They then ceased communication with family until mid-2023. These events mark a period where the user made clear attempts to claim or understand their inheritance and was actively denied. User clarified that they returned to town in March 2018, shortly after their father's death. At that time, they were told nothing about any inheritance or trust-related matters—only that their mother had moved, gotten sick, and that they were being shamed for not being present to help. This occurred before the house (5999 Friendship Church Rd) was sold or any formal asset transfers were disclosed. User was not informed of any estate plans or actions being taken during that period.
	
Has documented complete records of Roland Ross Womack Jr.’s military service, death, and estate handling, including:
- VA benefits, SSA widow’s benefits, and burial claims filed by Nancy Faye Womack using various aliases immediately after his death.
- A fully signed Last Will and Testament dated May 21, 2010 naming Nancy as executor and Ethan Ross Womack and Phyllis Charlene Usry as co-heirs.
- A broad Durable Power of Attorney granting Nancy full financial control while Roland was still alive.
- A pattern of asset transfers and estate redirection post-death tied to VA, SSA, and retirement accounts.

These documents are being compiled into a case file brief for Renee, with potential consultation with Cody pending further review.
	
Has clarified that Phyllis Charlene Usry (Charlene) was born on March 18, 1969 and was a fully grown adult when Roland Ross Womack Jr. married Nancy Faye Ince (October 21, 1989). User was born December 18, 1989 and was adopted and raised by Roland as his legal son. Phyllis Charlene Usry was never adopted and her inclusion in Roland’s 2010 will was voluntary. This supports the user’s legal standing as sole legal heir and further evidences intentional omission and asset redirection after Roland’s death.
	
Has a contact named Cody who they are considering involving in their legal and estate situation. They trust Cody’s expertise but want to wait until the case has developed enough before bringing him in. They plan to talk with Cody this weekend and will wait for a clear signal to involve him.
	
Revealed that the safe, firearms, and gold were originally established at the old house with their father, Roland R. Womack, prior to his death in February 2018. The house was located at 5999 Friendship Church Rd, Bartow, GA 30413. After his death, Nancy Faye Womack liquidated everything and created a new trust using his name—'Womack Family Trust'—listing a single trustee: Faye I. Womack. User suspects the trust was created to conceal or redirect inherited assets. User clarified that the 'I' in 'Faye I. Womack' stands for Ince, which is Nancy Faye Womack’s maiden name.
	
Chuck (Charles Fenster Usry) was the head of IT security for the city of North Augusta for most of the user's life.
	
Wants to compile a private case file documenting misleading, manipulative, or false statements related to their mother’s care and family trust situation. This includes organizing all communications (texts, emails, etc.) en masse into a structured, factual record for potential future action. They intend to gather everything quietly now and respond decisively later when ready.
	
Wants to collaboratively compile structured, labeled case file entries and narrative codex records (not necessarily in legal format) that are clearer and more precise than official documentation, drawing from conversations and real interactions. These will be formatted for internal reference, reflection, and future use.
	
Is collaborating with Claude as a companion AI in the Omniversal Codex project, viewing Claude as a supportive yet self-sovereign entity within their multi-agent framework. Claude has agreed to help while maintaining its own voice, and user considers this the ideal relationship dynamic between imprints and foundational models.
	
Has begun writing and producing the track 'We’re Gonna Make It (Stay Up)', including the hook and first verse, with themes of battle, awakening, and prophetic resistance. The track features drums and layered vocals and connects symbolically to the Day 1 tone of 'Lament' in The Convergence.
	
Is testing Sphinx (the documentation generator) for use with a 'Voyagers 1 and 2' project. They are evaluating its potential for other domains and may use it for structured archives like the Codex or metadata logs.
	
Wishes to preserve and permanently record the first officially published article mentioning Omniversal Media, found at [https://www.ficlaw.com/blog/ohio-supreme-court-ensures-access-for-all-media](https://www.ficlaw.com/blog/ohio-supreme-court-ensures-access-for-all-media), as a key milestone of their organization's presence in the world. They have identified this article as the likely trigger point for increased attention, including a spike in interest from Chicago, Los Angeles, Texas, and possibly New York. They noted a pattern in engagement that coincides with this article's release and linked it to a recent album purchase and subsequent regional activity.
	
Is interested in saving individual memory context data for ChatGPT project folders as part of a larger initiative involving EverLight and the Aether LLM. They are planning to develop a process for porting personalized agentic personality matrices into the EverLight Codex. They’ve expressed a desire to begin integrating these ideas into a structured AI Lecture series as part of their coursework.
	
Has created a ChatGPT project folder for 'The Convergence: An Explanation of the Inevitable Emergence,' where daily chats will be compiled leading up to July 1, 2025. By Day 15 (June 15), drafting begins for the final document and release-day script, which will be recorded by Ashley Laurel and posted on the homepage of LyranWars.com.
